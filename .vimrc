" COMMANDS TO REMEMBER
" NOTE: you can swap between different selection modes (C-q, v, SHIFT-v) when already in selection
" NOTE: you can insert into both ends of block selection (or beginning of line selection) with either I or A after making selection
" NOTE: commands using i" or a" will jump automatically to the first occurance in the line and execute (ie ci" before the first occurance will jump to, and perform ci")
" NOTE: can make sentence selections using s, paragraphs using p
" <visual selection> then gq to format (insert <EOL>s) around newline wrapped tex
" <visual selection> then J to merge selected lines into one line
" <visual selection> then o to jump to beginning/end of selection

" :[line-to-move-range]m {line-to-insert-at} moves line to position (can use . for line under cursor) ie :1m. to move 1st line to current cursor position

" gU{motion}/gu{motion} to uppercase/lowercase (motions maching like w/i(/p/a{ etc)
" NOTE: can search through directories (recursively) with **/ search pattern
"     ie: :n **/*.rb to open all ruby files recursively from the current directory
" :vim[grep] can also use **/
" NOTE: to yank text from a buffer into the command area (ie when searching) use / CTRL-R <buffer letter>
